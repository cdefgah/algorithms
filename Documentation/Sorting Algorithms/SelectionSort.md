# Selection Sort

The algorithm of sorting by selection is not a stable sorting algorithm, which consists of searching the raw slice of an array or list for the minimum value and then exchanging this value with the first element of the raw slice (minimum search and permutation). The next step is to reduce the raw slice by one element.

Here is the video of the selection sorting example:

## Time and space complexity

|              	| Time complexity 	| Space complexity 	|
|--------------	|-----------------	|------------------	|
| Worst case   	| O(N^2)          	| O(1)             	|
| Average case 	| O(N^2)          	| O(1)             	|
| Best case    	| O(N^2)           	| O(1)             	|
