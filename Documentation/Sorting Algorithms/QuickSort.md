# Quick Sort

Quicksort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works by splitting an array (partition) into smaller ones and swapping the smaller ones based on a comparison with the selected pivot element. Most implementations of quicksort are not stable, i.e. the relative order of the same sort elements is not preserved.

There are two different partitioning schemes that can be used in the implementation of the quicksort algorithm: Hoare and Lomuto.
